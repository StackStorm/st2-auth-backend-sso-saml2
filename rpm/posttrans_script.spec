# NOTE: This is a work around for a bug with RPM script introduced in v3.0.0.
# Because of a bug introduced in that issue Python package would get incorrectly
# removed on upgrade to a new version of that RPM package.
# As a workaround, we reinstall the package on %posttrans of new package which
# runs at the very end
# This will result in double Python package installation on fresh install and
# upgrade, but that's harmless
# TODO: Remove this in v3.4.0
